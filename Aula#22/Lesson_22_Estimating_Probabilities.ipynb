We are now able to launch a spacecraft from Earth and predict it will arrive on Mars at a certain time and location. However, it looks like not everything is as easy to predict as the trajectory of a spacecraft.\n","\n","Take tossing a coin, for instance — as ridiculous as it may sound, we're not able to predict with certainty whether the coin is going to land on heads or tails. And that's because a coin toss is a very complex phenomenon. The outcome depends on mutiple factors — the strength and the angle of the toss, the friction of the coin with air, the landing angle, the surface the coin lands on, etc.\n","\n","<img width=\"800\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1g-X6moFjytwUcaT3FNjyzeDWfuH3D8DN\">\n","\n","Although we can't tell beforehand the outcome of a coin toss, we'll learn in this lesson that we're able to at least estimate the **probability** (the chances) of a coin landing on heads or tails.

Whenever we can't predict outcomes with certainty, we're dealing with a **random experiment**.\n","\n","The toss of a coin is a random experiment, just like drawing lottery numbers or rolling a die. The term \"experiment\" might make you think about science, but the term here has a wider meaning — a random experiment is any process for which we can't predict outcomes with certainty.\n","\n","Although we can't predict the outcome of a random experiment, we can at least estimate the probability (the chances) associated with its outcomes. A coin toss has two possible outcomes, and we can estimate the probability associated with the coin landing on heads or tails.\n","\n","Let's say we're interested in estimating the probability of a coin landing on heads. To estimate the probability, we can take the following steps:\n","\n","- Toss the coin many times (thus repeating the random experiment).\n","- Count the number of times the coin landed on heads.\n","- Divide the number of heads by the total number of times we tossed the coin.\n","\n","Dividing the number of heads by the total number of times we tossed the coin gives us the probability of a coin landing heads up. Let's say we tossed a coin 100 times and got heads 56 times. We find the probability of a coin landing heads up by dividing the number of heads (56) by the total number of times we tossed the coin (100). This is $\\displaystyle \\frac{56}{100}$, so the probability of a coin landing heads up is 0.56.\n","\n","<img width=\"600\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=12FrlOK4BOcNkFT0wXRVo4totpWAv31Mj\">\n","\n","In probability notation, we could write this as:\n","\n","$\n","Probability(coin \\  lands \\  heads \\  up) = 0.56\n","$\n","\n","We read the mathematical expression above as \"the probability of the event coin lands heads up is 0.56.\" For simplicity, the notation is often compressed, and \"Probability\" becomes \"P\", while \"coin lands heads up\" becomes simply \"heads\" or \"H\":\n","\n","$\n","P(H) = 0.56\n","$\n","\n","In other resources, you may find a slightly different notation, like $p(H)$  or $Pr(H)$ , but $P(H)$ is generally preferred.\n","\n","Generally, for any event \"E\" (like a coin landing heads up), we can find its probability by using the following formula:\n","\n","$\n","P(E) = \\displaystyle \\frac{number \\ of \\ times \\ event \\ E \\ happened}{number \\ of \\ times \\ we \\ repeated \\ the \\ experiment}\n","$\n","\n","When we calculate the probability of an event by performing an experiment one or more times, we calculate the **experimental** — or **empirical probability** — of the event.
