in the last exercise we found the mean more informative and representative than the median. The truth is that in practice many people get past the theoretical hurdles and use the mean nonetheless because in many cases it's much richer in information than the median.\n","\n","Let's consider a situation where the mean is arguably a much better choice to measure the average of an ordinal variable. Let's say we're working for an online real estate company which allows customers to buy, sell, and rent houses. The speed on our website is important for all of our customers, and we want to measure how the customers perceive the speed on the website.\n","\n","We sample randomly 10 customers and have them assess the following sentence: \"The website is very fast, usually a new page loads in less than a second\". The customers can choose between the following answers, which we plan to code under the hood with numbers between 1 and 5:\n","\n","| Code | Answer                     |\n","|------|----------------------------|\n","| 1    | Strongly disagree          |\n","| 2    | Disagree                   |\n","| 3    | Neither agree nor disagree |\n","| 4    | Agree                      |\n","| 5    | Strongly agree             |\n","\n","The survey yielded the distribution below, whose mean and median have both a value of 2:\n","\n","$$\n","[1,1,1,2,2,2,2,3,3,3]\n","$$\n","\n","After being presented with the results, the engineering team implemented a few changes meant to improve speed, and now we repeat the survey on another random sample of 10 customers and get these results:\n","\n","$$\n","[1,2,2,2,2,2,4,5,5,5]\n","$$\n","\n","The median is still 2, and it suggests that nothing changed. The mean, however, went up to 3, suggesting that the changes our engineers made have had a positive effect. Unlike the median, the mean is sensitive to small changes in the data, and this property is what makes it more useful in this case.\n","\n","It should be clear by now that whether we should use the mean for ordinal data is contentious. In practice, you should be flexible and make your choice on a case by case basis. Also, you are not constrained to choose one metric or the other — you can choose both the mean and median to describe a distribution."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"aJvKm5S_Pbow","colab_type":"text"},"source":["# 9 - Next steps"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"5DAFGPc2RFdQ","colab_type":"text"},"source":["In this mission, we learned about the weighted mean and the median.

For ordinal data, if we encode the attributes with numbers it becomes possible to compute the mean, but this is contentious and raises theoretical issues.\n","\n","In the next mission, we continue the discussion about finding averages for ordinal data and also learn new things, like finding the average value for nominal variables.\n"]}]}
